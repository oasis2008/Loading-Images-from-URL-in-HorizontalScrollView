##Loading Images from URL in HorizontalScrollView


Loading images in a horizontal scrollview, without using a Gallery. 
I've used a third party library for setting the content of the imageView from URL. https://github.com/koush/UrlImageViewHelper . 
Thanks man! :) 

I have created a custom UI component for displaying the image.
